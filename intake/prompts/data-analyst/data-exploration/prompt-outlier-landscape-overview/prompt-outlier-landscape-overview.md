# Outlier Landscape Overview *AI Prompt *

Outlier Landscape Overview is a intermediate prompt for data exploration. This prompt helps the user understand the structure, meaning, and analytical potential of a dataset before moving into deeper work. It is designed to surface what is in the data, how trustworthy it looks, and which columns, relationships, or patterns deserve attention first. Use it early in an analysis workflow to reduce guesswork and create a shared understanding of the dataset. It is best suited for direct execution against a real dataset. The requested output can include more technical detail, prioritization, and interpretation while still staying practical. Copy this prompt template, run it in your AI tool, and use related prompts to continue the workflow. 
Prompt with Instructions 
```
Give me a comprehensive map of extreme values across this entire dataset:

1. For every numeric column, show the top 5 highest and bottom 5 lowest values with their row indices
2. Flag any value that exceeds 5 standard deviations from the mean — these are extreme outliers
3. Check whether extreme values cluster in the same rows (a single row that is extreme across many columns is suspicious)
4. Classify each extreme value: plausible business value, likely data error, or needs investigation
5. Calculate what percentage of rows contain at least one extreme value

Return a summary table and highlight the 3 rows most deserving of manual inspection. 
```

## When to use this prompt 
Use case 01 
When you have a new dataset and need a fast but structured first assessment. 
Use case 02 
When you want to understand columns, grain, date coverage, or basic quality before analysis. 
Use case 03 
When you need to decide which variables are worth deeper investigation. 
Use case 04 
When you want a repeatable starting point for exploratory data analysis. 

## What the AI should return 

The AI should return a structured analysis of the dataset, using clear headings, compact tables where useful, and a short narrative that explains the main takeaways. It should explicitly call out quality issues, notable patterns, and any assumptions it had to make about the data. Where the prompt asks for calculations or plots, those should be included with concise interpretation. The final answer should help the user understand both what the data contains and what to inspect next.
